# ðŸŽ¨ Colour Palette Generator
Generate millions of beautiful colour palettes with clicks! <br />
This is a feature rich project and I tried to emulate the ***coolors.co*** website as close as possible. <br /><br />

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
1. <code>HTML</code><br />
2. <code>CSS</code><br />
3. <code>Javascript</code><br />

## âœ¨ Features
**1. Generate Random Colour Palettes** <br />
**2. Save/Bookmark Palettes to local storage for future use** <br />
**3. Export Palettes in three different formats: <code>JSON</code>, <code>CSS</code>, and <code>Text</code>** <br />
**4. Add, remove, lock, edit, and view shades and tints of a specific colour** <br />

## Installation Guide
- Clone the repository by running this command on your terminal
  ``` terminal
  git clone https://github.com/zakkariyaa/color-palette
  ```
- Open the cloned repository in your preferred code editor
- You can also run the Index.html file through your browser if needed

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
- How to structure a front-end project in a clean, modular way
- Deepened my understanding of colour theory, brightness, shades, and tints
- Worked with colour conversions and handling multiple colour formats effectively

## ðŸ”§ Potential Improvements
- If I had more time, I'd love to:
- Complete the addColour feature to dynamically update the page
- Refactor certain parts of the code using higher-order functions for better readability
- Add more of the original Coolors features (e.g., palette sorting, harmony suggestions)

## Improvements *(optional)*
If I had more time I would try to improve the following things:
- Complete the <code>addColour</code> functionality so the changes are dynamically reflected on the page <br />
- Refactor the codebase to use higher order function in some places instead of loops
- Add the rest of the Coolers.co website features
