# Colour Palette Generator
![webpage screenshot](https://github.com/zakkariyaa/color-palette/blob/master/assets/colour-palette.png)<br /><br />
Generate millions of beautiful colour palettes with clicks! <br />
This project was built as part of ***FAC's*** bootcamp admission projects. <br />
Its feature rich and we tried to emulate the ***coolers.co*** website as close as possible.

## Tech Stack
1. <code>HTML</code><br />
2. <code>CSS</code><br />
3. <code>Javascript</code><br />

## Features
**1. Generate Random Colour Palettes** <br />
**2. Save/Bookmark Palettes to local storage for future use** <br />
**3. Export Palettes in three different formats: <code>JSON</code>, <code>CSS</code>, and <code>Text</code>** <br />
**4. Add, remove, lock, edit, and view shades and tints of a specific colour** <br />

## Installation Guide
- Clone the repository by running this command on your terminal
  ``` terminal
  git clone https://github.com/zakkariyaa/color-palette
  ```
- Open the cloned repository in your preferred code editor
  - You can also run the Index.html file through your browser if needed

## Learnings
- I have learned how to organize a project in a modular way <br />
- Got a pretty good idea about *'Colour theory'*, colour brightness levels, shades, tints...
 - Colour conversions and how to handle different colour formats

## Improvements *(optional)*
If i had more time i would try to improve the following things:
- Complete the <code>addColour</code> functionality so the changes are dynamically reflected on the page <br />
- Refactor the codebase to use higher order function in some places instead of loops
- Add the rest of the Coolers.co website features
